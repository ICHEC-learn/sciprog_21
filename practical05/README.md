## Practical 5

### scanning.c
- In this program we will take the value of integer and double from user using scanf.
- Store the value of integer in pointer and printing the address and value using pointers.

### fibonacci.c
- In this program we will display the fibonacci series.
- Fetch the input n from user.
- Looping from 1 to n and calculating the series using Fn-2 + Fn-1.

### arctan2.c
- In this program we will calculate the hyperbolic tan result.
- Fetch the input precision and range from user.
- Calculate the result using Maclurian Series and logarithmic approach.
- Compare both the results
