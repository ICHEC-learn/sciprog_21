- Initializing a number integer.
- Converting the given to binary format.
- counting the number of digits in binary format.

## Sum.c
- Program to find the sum of 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ...... + 1/1000.
- In the 1st case we will compute the sum from i = 1 to 1000
- In the 2nd case we will compute the sum from i = 1000 to 1.
- Compute the difference between 2 sums.
